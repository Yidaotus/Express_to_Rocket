# Simple Rocket.rs port of an Express.js server

This is the source of my corresponding blog about porting a simple Express.js application to Rocket.rs.
For educational purpose only. I'm also still learning rust, so any constructive criticism is explicitly welcomed!

## Use
The latest version of Rocket.rs is expected. You can simply clone the Rockt repo into your directory and checkout the master branch!

Start with `cargo run`
